= Goldsweeper Rules

In Goldsweeper, you must mine for gold! Be careful; the more gold you find, the more bombs and thieves are nearby!

Make a fortune in this _Legend of Zelda_-inspired digital board game!

== Objective

To score as many points as you can.

== Gameplay

Each turn, you choose a square on an 8 by 8 grid.

The square will light up. The color of the square tells you what you've found.
Once you hit a bomb, the game ends and the entire board lights up.

== The Game Board

The game board has 8 rows and 8 columns.
There are three categories of squares:

* Gold -- Gives you points and tells you how many bombs and thieves are nearby.
* Thief -- Steals 10 points from you.
* Bomb -- Explodes and ends the game.
